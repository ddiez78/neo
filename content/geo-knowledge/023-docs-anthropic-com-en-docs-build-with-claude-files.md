Messages Working with files

The Files API lets you upload and manage files to use with the Claude API without re-uploading content with each request. This is particularly useful when using the [code execution tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool) to provide inputs (e.g. datasets and documents) and then download outputs (e.g. charts). You can also use the Files API to prevent having to continually re-upload frequently used documents and images across multiple API calls. You can [explore the API reference directly](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/files-create), in addition to this guide.

The Files API is in beta. Reach out through the [feedback form](https://forms.gle/tisHyierGwgN4DUE9) to share your experience with the Files API.

This feature is **not** eligible for [Zero Data Retention (ZDR)](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/api-and-data-retention). Data is retained according to the feature's standard retention policy.

## Supported models

Referencing a `file_id` in a Messages request is supported on all models that support the given file type. [Images](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision) are supported on all current Claude models. For [PDFs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/pdf-support) and [other file types with the code execution tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool#model-compatibility), see the linked pages for model support.

The Files API is available on the Claude API, [Claude Platform on AWS](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-platform-on-aws), and [Microsoft Foundry](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-microsoft-foundry). It is not currently available on Amazon Bedrock or Vertex AI.

## How the Files API works

The Files API provides a simple create-once, use-many-times approach for working with files:

*   **Upload files** to Anthropic's secure storage and receive a unique `file_id`
*   **Download files** that are created from skills or the code execution tool
*   **Reference files** in [Messages](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/messages/create) requests using the `file_id` instead of re-uploading content
*   **Manage your files** with list, retrieve, and delete operations

## How to use the Files API

To use the Files API, you'll need to include the beta feature header: `anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14`.

### Uploading a file

Upload a file to be referenced in future API calls:

The response from uploading a file will include:

### Using a file in messages

Once uploaded, reference the file using its `file_id`:

### File types and content blocks

The Files API supports different file types that correspond to different content block types:

| File Type | MIME Type | Content Block Type | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PDF | `application/pdf` | `document` | Text analysis, document processing |
| Plain text | `text/plain` | `document` | Text analysis, processing |
| Images | `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, `image/webp` | `image` | Image analysis, visual tasks |
| [Datasets, others](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool#upload-and-analyze-your-own-files) | Varies | `container_upload` | Analyze data, create visualizations |

### Working with other file formats

For file types that are not supported as `document` blocks (.csv, .txt, .md, .docx, .xlsx), convert the files to plain text, and include the content directly in your message:

For .docx files containing images, convert them to PDF format first, then use [PDF support](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/pdf-support) to take advantage of the built-in image parsing. This allows using citations from the PDF document.

#### Document blocks

For PDFs and text files, use the `document` content block:

#### Image blocks

For images, use the `image` content block:

### Managing files

#### List files

Retrieve a list of your uploaded files:

Retrieve information about a specific file:

#### Delete a file

Remove a file from your workspace:

### Downloading a file

Download files that have been created by skills or the code execution tool:

You can only download files that were created by [skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/skills-guide) or the [code execution tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool). Files that you uploaded cannot be downloaded.

* * *

## File storage and limits

### Storage limits

*   **Maximum file size:** 500 MB per file
*   **Total storage:** 500 GB per organization

### File lifecycle

*   Files are scoped to the workspace of the API key. Other API keys can use files created by any other API key associated with the same workspace
*   Files persist until you delete them
*   Deleted files cannot be recovered
*   Files are inaccessible via the API shortly after deletion, but they may persist in active `Messages` API calls and associated tool uses
*   Files that users delete will be deleted in accordance with Anthropic's [data retention policy](https://privacy.claude.com/en/articles/7996866-how-long-do-you-store-my-organization-s-data).

* * *

## Data retention

Files uploaded via the Files API are retained until explicitly deleted using the `DELETE /v1/files/{file_id}` endpoint. Files are stored for reuse across multiple API requests.

For ZDR eligibility across all features, see [API and data retention](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/api-and-data-retention).

## Error handling

Common errors when using the Files API include:

*   **File not found (404):** The specified `file_id` doesn't exist or you don't have access to it
*   **Invalid file type (400):** The file type doesn't match the content block type (e.g., using an image file in a document block)
*   **Exceeds context window size (400):** The file is larger than the context window size (e.g. using a 500 MB plaintext file in a `/v1/messages` request)
*   **Invalid filename (400):** Filename doesn't meet the length requirements (1-255 characters) or contains forbidden characters (`<`, `>`, `:`, `"`, `|`, `?`, `*`, `\`, `/`, or unicode characters 0-31)
*   **File too large (413):** File exceeds the 500 MB limit
*   **Storage limit exceeded (403):** Your organization has reached the 500 GB storage limit

## Usage and billing

File API operations are **free**:

*   Uploading files
*   Downloading files
*   Listing files
*   Getting file metadata
*   Deleting files

File content used in `Messages` requests are priced as input tokens. You can only download files created by [skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/skills-guide) or the [code execution tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool).

### Rate limits

During the beta period:

*   File-related API calls are limited to approximately 100 requests per minute
*   [Contact us](mailto:sales@anthropic.com) if you need higher limits for your use case
