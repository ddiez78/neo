[Semantic search](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/semantic-search) and [lexical search](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/lexical-search) are powerful information retrieval techniques, but each has notable limitations. For example:
*   Semantic search can miss results based on exact keyword matches, especially in scenarios involving domain-specific terminology.
*   Lexical search can miss results based on relationships, such as synonyms and paraphrases.

To work around these limitations, you can use hybrid search, which combines semantic and lexical search.

This page covers the **vector-API hybrid pattern**: a single index that stores both a dense vector and a sparse vector per record, queried together in one request. For indexes with document schemas, hybrid retrieval is covered in [Full-text search](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/full-text-search), where one schema declares FTS-enabled `string` (BM25), `dense_vector`, and `sparse_vector` fields side by side and you combine signals with text-match filters or by merging results client-side. For multi-signal indexes that combine dense, sparse, and text fields in a single schema, see the [Multi-signal index pattern](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/index-data/data-modeling#schema-patterns). Both patterns are fully supported; pick by data shape (records vs. JSON documents).

When you query a single index that stores both dense and sparse vectors, BM25 scores and `pinecone-sparse-english-v0` sparse-weight outputs are **not normalized** to the dense vector range (cosine `[-1, 1]`). Without explicit weighting, the sparse component dominates the combined score. Before going to production, read [Normalize sparse and dense values](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#normalize-sparse-and-dense-values) and apply the `hybrid_score_norm` query-time pattern — or model the workload as an [index with a document schema](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/get-started/concepts#document) and combine BM25 with a dense or sparse ranking using a text-match filter (or client-side merge) per [Full-text search](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/full-text-search).

## [​](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#choosing-a-hybrid-pattern)

Choosing a hybrid pattern

Pinecone supports three hybrid patterns, split by API surface and data shape. Pick the one that matches your data:

| Pattern | API | Data shape | How signals combine | Trade-offs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[Single index for dense and sparse vectors](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#use-a-single-index-for-dense-and-sparse-vectors)** | Vector | One record carries both a dense and a sparse vector | Server-side dotproduct of weighted dense + sparse query vectors | Simplest single-request architecture, but BM25/sparse scores are unbounded — requires `alpha` weighting per query. No integrated embedding. |
| **[Separate indexes for dense and sparse vectors](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#use-separate-indexes-for-dense-and-sparse-vectors)** | Vector | Two indexes, linked by shared `_id` | Two queries, merged client-side (e.g., RRF) | More moving parts, but supports sparse-only queries, integrated embedding, and independent reranking per index. |
| **[Multi-field document schema](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/full-text-search)** | Document | One document with `dense_vector` + FTS-enabled `string` fields in the same schema | Either: dense ranking _narrowed_ by a text-match filter (`$match_phrase`/`$match_all`/`$match_any`); or two searches merged client-side | Text-centric workloads; no `alpha` tuning needed. Doesn’t support integrated embedding in public preview. |

**Rule of thumb:** if your hybrid signal is “I have both vectors per record,” reach for a vector-API pattern (single index or separate indexes). If your hybrid signal is “I have text plus an embedding for the same document,” reach for the document API (multi-field document schema).The remainder of this page covers the vector-API patterns. For the document API hybrid pattern, see [Full-text search](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/full-text-search) and the [multi-signal schema example](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/index-data/data-modeling#schema-patterns).
## [​](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#hybrid-search-approaches)

Hybrid search approaches

There are two ways to perform hybrid search **on the vector API**:
*   [Use a single index for dense and sparse vectors](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#use-a-single-index-for-dense-and-sparse-vectors). This is the **recommended** approach for most use cases because it provides a simpler architecture with less operational overhead.

 Steps: 
    1.   [Create the index](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#hybrid-single-1-create)
    2.   [Generate vectors](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#hybrid-single-2-embed)
    3.   [Upsert records](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#hybrid-single-3-upsert)
    4.   [Search the index](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#hybrid-single-4-query)
    5.   [Search with explicit weighting](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#hybrid-single-5-alpha)

*   [Use separate indexes for dense and sparse vectors](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#use-separate-indexes-for-dense-and-sparse-vectors). This approach provides more flexibility but requires managing two indexes and maintaining linkages between vectors.

 Steps: 
    1.   [Create the indexes](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#hybrid-sep-1-create)
    2.   [Upsert vectors](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#hybrid-sep-2-upsert)
    3.   [Search by dense vectors](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#hybrid-sep-3-dense)
    4.   [Search by sparse vectors](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#hybrid-sep-4-sparse)
    5.   [Merge and deduplicate](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#hybrid-sep-5-merge)
    6.   [Rerank](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#hybrid-sep-6-rerank)

The following table summarizes the key differences between the two approaches:

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single index for both vectors | * You make requests to only a single index. * The linkage between dense and sparse vectors is implicit. * Simpler architecture with less operational overhead. | * You can’t do sparse-only queries. * You can’t use integrated embedding and reranking. |
| Separate indexes per vector type | * You can start with dense vectors for semantic search and add sparse vectors for lexical search later. * You can do sparse-only queries. * You can rerank at multiple levels (for each index and for merged results). * You can use integrated embedding and reranking. | * You need to manage and make requests to two separate indexes. * You need to maintain the linkage between sparse and dense vectors across indexes. * More complex architecture with additional operational overhead. |

## [​](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#choosing-the-right-approach)

Choosing the right approach

**For most use cases, a single index that stores both dense and sparse vectors is recommended.**
*   This approach provides a simpler architecture with less operational overhead. You make requests to a single index rather than managing and querying two separate indexes.
*   The linkage between dense and sparse vectors is implicit, eliminating the need to maintain explicit linkages across indexes.
*   You can perform hybrid queries with a single request, reducing latency and complexity compared to querying separate indexes and merging results.

**Consider using separate indexes only when:**
*   You need to do sparse-only queries.
*   You want to use Pinecone’s integrated sparse model ([`pinecone-sparse-english-v0`](https://docs.pinecone.io/models/pinecone-sparse-english-v0)), which only works with indexes that store sparse vectors.
*   You need complete independence in reranking results from each index.
*   You require the flexibility to manage dense and sparse vectors in separate indexes.

## [​](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#normalize-sparse-and-dense-values)

Normalize sparse and dense values

A single index that stores both vector types doesn’t reconcile their score ranges. The two scoring components have very different shapes:
*   **Dense vectors** scored with `dotproduct` against unit-norm embeddings produce values roughly in `[-1, 1]` (or close, depending on the embedding model).
*   **BM25-style sparse weights** and `pinecone-sparse-english-v0` outputs are **unbounded positive** values that scale with term frequency, document length, and vocabulary distribution. Raw scores can run into double digits.

Without explicit weighting, the sparse component dominates the combined score. To make the two signals comparable, apply a **convex combination** at query time using an `alpha` parameter:
*   `combined = alpha * dense + (1 - alpha) * sparse`
*   `alpha = 1.0` ranks by dense only (pure semantic).
*   `alpha = 0.0` ranks by sparse only (pure lexical).
*   `alpha = 0.5` weights the two signals equally.

Pinecone applies this weighting by **scaling the query vectors before sending them to the index** (the index itself stores raw values). Use the [`hybrid_score_norm`](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#search-the-index-with-explicit-weighting) helper documented in the walkthrough below; it multiplies the dense values by `alpha` and the sparse values by `1 - alpha`, so the underlying dotproduct produces the desired combination.
### [​](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#choosing-alpha)

Choosing alpha

There’s no universal best value — alpha depends on your data and query distribution. Reasonable starting points:
*   **`alpha = 0.75`** (dense-leaning) — good default for natural-language queries on conversational or document-style content.
*   **`alpha = 0.5`** — balanced; useful when keyword and semantic signals contribute equally (e.g., mixed exact-match and synonym queries).
*   **`alpha = 0.25`** (sparse-leaning) — good for queries with high keyword specificity (product SKUs, technical IDs, named entities).

We recommend evaluating multiple alpha values against a labeled relevance set drawn from your own workload.

If your workload is text-centric, an [index with a document schema](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/get-started/concepts#document) sidesteps the alpha-tuning step entirely: declare BM25 and vector fields in one schema and pick a ranking signal per query, with no normalization to fit. See [Full-text search](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/full-text-search).

## [​](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#use-a-single-index-for-dense-and-sparse-vectors)

Use a single index for dense and sparse vectors

To perform hybrid search with a single index that stores both dense and sparse vectors, follow these steps:

1

[](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#)

Create the index

[](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search)To store both dense and sparse vectors in a single index, use the [`create_index`](https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/api/latest/control-plane/create_index) operation, setting the `vector_type` to `dense` and the `metric` to `dotproduct`. This is the only combination that supports dense/sparse search on a single index.

Python

```
from pinecone.grpc import PineconeGRPC as Pinecone
from pinecone import ServerlessSpec

pc = Pinecone(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

index_name = "hybrid-index"

if not pc.has_index(index_name):
    pc.create_index(
        name=index_name,
        vector_type="dense",
        dimension=1024,
        metric="dotproduct",
        spec=ServerlessSpec(
            cloud="aws",
            region="us-east-1"
        )
    )
```

Upsert records with dense and sparse vectors

[](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search)Use the [`upsert`](https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/api/latest/data-plane/upsert) operation, specifying dense values in the `value` parameter and sparse values in the `sparse_values` parameter.

Only indexes that store dense vectors with the [dotproduct distance metric](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/index-data/indexing-overview#dotproduct) accept records that also have sparse vectors. Upserting such records into an index with a different distance metric will succeed, but querying will return an error.

Python

```
# Target the index
# To get the unique host for an index, 
# see https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/manage-data/target-an-index
index = pc.Index(host="INDEX_HOST")

# Each record contains an ID, a dense vector, a sparse vector, and the original text as metadata
records = []
for d, de, se in zip(data, dense_embeddings, sparse_embeddings):
    records.append({
        "id": d['_id'],
        "values": de['values'],
        "sparse_values": {'indices': se['sparse_indices'], 'values': se['sparse_values']},
        "metadata": {'text': d['chunk_text']}
    })

# Upsert the records into the index
index.upsert(
    vectors=records,

Search the index

[](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search)Use the [`embed`](https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/api/latest/inference/generate-embeddings) operation to convert your query into a dense vector and a sparse vector, and then use the [`query`](https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/api/latest/data-plane/query) operation to search the index for the 40 most relevant records.

Python

```
query = "Q3 2024 us economic data"

# Convert the query into a dense vector
dense_query_embedding = pc.inference.embed(
    model="llama-text-embed-v2",
    inputs=query,

Search the index with explicit weighting

[](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search)For a conceptual overview of why this normalization is needed, see [Normalize sparse and dense values](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#normalize-sparse-and-dense-values).Because Pinecone views your sparse-dense vector as a single vector, it does not offer a built-in parameter to adjust the weight of a query’s dense part against its sparse part; the index is agnostic to density or sparsity of coordinates in your vectors. You may, however, incorporate a linear weighting scheme by customizing your query vector, as demonstrated in the function below.The following example transforms vector values using an alpha parameter.

Python

```
def hybrid_score_norm(dense, sparse, alpha: float):
    """Hybrid score using a convex combination

    alpha * dense + (1 - alpha) * sparse

    Args:
        dense: Array of floats representing
        sparse: a dict of `indices` and `values`
        alpha: scale between 0 and 1
    """
    if alpha < 0 or alpha > 1:
        raise ValueError("Alpha must be between 0 and 1")
    hs = {
        'indices': sparse['indices'],
        'values':  [v * (1 - alpha) for v in sparse['values']]
    }
    return [v * alpha for v in dense], hs
```

The following example transforms a vector using the above function, then queries a Pinecone index.

Python

```
sparse_vector = {
   'indices': [10, 45, 16],
   'values':  [0.5, 0.5, 0.2]
}
dense_vector = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]

hdense, hsparse = hybrid_score_norm(dense_vector, sparse_vector, alpha=0.75)

query_response = index.query(
    namespace="example-namespace",
    top_k=10,
    vector=hdense,
    sparse_vector=hsparse
)
```

## [​](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#use-separate-indexes-for-dense-and-sparse-vectors)

Use separate indexes for dense and sparse vectors

To perform hybrid search with separate indexes, follow these steps:

1

[](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search#)

Create the indexes

[](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search)[Create one index for dense vectors](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/index-data/create-an-index#create-an-index-for-dense-vectors) and [another for sparse vectors](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/index-data/create-an-index#create-an-index-for-sparse-vectors), either with integrated embedding or for vectors created with external models.For example, the following code creates indexes with integrated embedding models.

Python

```
from pinecone import Pinecone

pc = Pinecone(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

dense_index_name = "dense-for-hybrid-py"
sparse_index_name = "sparse-for-hybrid-py"

if not pc.has_index(dense_index_name):
    pc.create_index_for_model(
        name=dense_index_name,
        cloud="aws",
        region="us-east-1",
        embed={
            "model":"llama-text-embed-v2",
            "field_map":{"text": "chunk_text"}
        }
    )

if not pc.has_index(sparse_index_name):
    pc.create_index_for_model(
        name=sparse_index_name,
        cloud="aws",
        region="us-east-1",
        embed={
            "model":"pinecone-sparse-english-v0",
            "field_map":{"text": "chunk_text"}
        }
    )

Upsert dense and sparse vectors

[](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search)[Upsert dense vectors](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/index-data/upsert-data#upsert-dense-vectors) and [upsert sparse vectors](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/index-data/upsert-data#upsert-sparse-vectors) into their respective indexes.Make sure to establish a linkage between the dense and sparse vectors so you can merge and deduplicate search results later. For example, the following uses `_id` as the linkage, but you can use any other custom field as well. Because the indexes are integrated with embedding models, you provide the source texts and Pinecone converts them to vectors automatically.

Search by dense vectors

[](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search)Perform a [semantic search](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/semantic-search) against the index that stores dense vectors.For example, the following code searches that index for 40 records most semantically related to the query “Q3 2024 us economic data”. Because the index is integrated with an embedding model, you provide the query as text and Pinecone converts the text to a dense vector automatically.

Python

```
query = "Q3 2024 us economic data"

dense_results = dense_index.search(
    namespace="example-namespace",
    query={
        "top_k": 40,
        "inputs": {
            "text": query

print(dense_results)

Search by sparse vectors

[](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search)Perform a [lexical search](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/lexical-search) against the index that stores sparse vectors.For example, the following code searches that index for 40 records that most exactly match the words in the query. Again, because the index is integrated with an embedding model, you provide the query as text and Pinecone converts the text to a sparse vector automatically.

Python

```
sparse_results = sparse_index.search(
    namespace="example-namespace",
    query={
        "top_k": 40,
        "inputs": {
            "text": query
        }
    }
)

print(sparse_results)
```

Merge and deduplicate the results

[](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search)Merge the 40 dense and 40 sparse results and deduplicated them based on the field you used to link sparse and dense vectors.For example, the following code merges and deduplicates the results based on the `_id` field, resulting in 52 unique results.

Python

```
def merge_chunks(h1, h2):
    """Get the unique hits from two search results and return them as single array of {'_id', 'chunk_text'} dicts, printing each dict on a new line."""
    # Deduplicate by _id
    deduped_hits = {hit['_id']: hit for hit in h1['result']['hits'] + h2['result']['hits']}.values()
    # Sort by _score descending
    sorted_hits = sorted(deduped_hits, key=lambda x: x['_score'], reverse=True)
    # Transform to format for reranking
    result = [{'_id': hit['_id'], 'chunk_text': hit['fields']['chunk_text']} for hit in sorted_hits]
    return result

merged_results = merge_chunks(sparse_results, dense_results)

print('[\n   ' + ',\n   '.join(str(obj) for obj in merged_results) + '\n]')

Rerank the results

[](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search)Use one of Pinecone’s [hosted reranking models](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/rerank-results#reranking-models) to rerank the merged and deduplicated results based on a unified relevance score and then return a smaller set of the most highly relevant results.For example, the following code sends the 52 unique results from the last step to the `bge-reranker-v2-m3` reranking model and returns the top 10 most relevant results.

Python

```
result = pc.inference.rerank(
    model="bge-reranker-v2-m3",
    query=query,
    documents=merged_results,
    rank_fields=["chunk_text"],
    top_n=10,
    return_documents=True,
    parameters={
        "truncate": "END"
    }
)

print("Query", query)
print('-----')
for row in result.data:
    print(f"{row['document']['_id']} - {round(row['score'], 2)} - {row['document']['chunk_text']}")
```
